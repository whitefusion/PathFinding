# PathFinding
This is a Path finding algorithm written in Java. <br/>
Basically, this program could compute the cloest route between driver and the customer, just like a car-calling software. <br/>
The program contains map information and driver location. And then once the location of customer is specified, the program will conmpute the 
route between available driver and customer. <br/>
The path planning algorithm implemented here is Dijkstra.

## Installation and Usage
Clone the repository into the working directory of Java SDK like Clion or Eclipse. <br/>
Create a new project and put everything under the directory of that project and run. <br/>
You can choose your location by typing location id, and then the closest 3 drivers will display on the console.
